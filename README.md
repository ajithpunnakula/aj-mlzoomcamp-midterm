# House Prices Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to process and analyze the House Prices dataset from Kaggle to predict housing prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset provides a rich feature set of house attributes, enabling us to build predictive models that estimate the sale price of each property.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on their features such as size, location, condition, etc. We will use machine learning algorithms to build models that can learn the relationships between various house features and the corresponding sale prices.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- **Description**: The dataset contains numerous features about houses, including but not limited to area, number of rooms, year built, and neighborhood quality.

## Requirements

To replicate this analysis, you'll need the following software and packages installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the nature and distribution of the data. Use data visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships.

2. **Cleaning**: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers. This may involve imputing missing data or removing outliers that could skew model performance.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to better capture important patterns in the dataset. This could involve normalization, encoding categorical variables, and polynomial feature generation.

4. **Splitting Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Training

1. **Selection**: Implement multiple machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting, and compare their performance.

2. **Training**: Use the training set to develop models, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

3. **Cross-Validation**: Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy.
- Fine-tune the models based on these metrics.

## Usage

To run the analysis and prediction models:

1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
2. Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the `data/` directory.
3. Use Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to execute the preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps as outlined.

Feel free to explore, modify, and improve the code to suit your needs or try different algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.
